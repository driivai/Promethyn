"""The orchestrator's ONLY door to action — and it is a one-way door.

The defining invariant of this layer: the orchestrator can sequence agents and
pass their outputs, but it has **no path to execute**. Every action any agent
proposes is submitted to the SAME gate every other action goes through; the
gate decides. The orchestrator cannot approve, cannot bypass, cannot reach the
executor.

That is enforced by *type* at the API level: an :class:`ActionGateway` wraps a
single ``submit`` callable — the existing :meth:`ExecutionController.submit` —
and exposes exactly one method, ``route_action``, which delegates to it. The
gateway and the runtime carry **no** ``execute``, ``approve``, ``gate``, or
``executor`` member; the orchestrator's whole vocabulary for touching the
world is ``route_action``, and it always ends at the gate. Just as the git
tool cannot ``push`` because push is not one of its operations, the
orchestrator cannot execute or approve because those operations are not on the
objects it holds. Human approval of a held action stays with whoever holds the
controller (the operator), never with the orchestrator.

HONEST CAVEAT (documented, not papered over): this is capability safety *in
Python*, so it is airtight only up to introspection. Because ``submit`` is a
bound method, ``gateway._submit.__self__`` is the controller, and a caller who
deliberately reaches through the object model could touch its human verbs —
exactly as ``git_tool._sandbox`` is reachable in principle. Two things bound
that caveat: it takes a deliberate ``__self__``/``__closure__`` escape, never
any capability the orchestration API offers; and even then the **gate is not
bypassable** — ``approve`` only executes an action the gate already *routed*
(a pending hold), never one it *blocked*, so no path lets the orchestrator run
what the gate refused. A process/capability boundary (a follow-up) is what
would close the introspection gap entirely; the gate-in-the-loop guarantee
holds today regardless.
